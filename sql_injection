This is a simple SQL injection attack based on user input. The attacker uses a form that requires first name and last name as inputs. The attacker inputs:

First name: malicious’ex
Last name: Smith
The SQL statement that processes the form inputs looks like this:

select id, firstname, lastname from authors

Once the attacker injects a malicious expression into the first name, the statement looks like this:

select id, firstname, lastname from authors where firstname = 'malicious'ex' and lastname ='newman'

The database identifies incorrect syntax due to the single apostrophe, and tries to execute the malicious statement.

Here is code from OWASP showing how to prevent this attack, by sanitizing the input. 

String firstname = req.getParameter("firstname");
String lastname = req.getParameter("lastname");
String query = "SELECT id, firstname, lastname FROM authors WHERE firstname = ? and lastname = ?";
// Using a PreparedStatement to take the user’s query and sanitize it 
// by setting it as a string, instead of directly passing it to DB
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement( query );
pstmt.setString( 1, firstname );
pstmt.setString( 2, lastname );
try
{
    ResultSet results = pstmt.execute( );
}
